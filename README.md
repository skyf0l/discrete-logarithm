Fast discrete logarithm solver in Rust.

The code is based on the [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) implementation and translated to Rust.

Based on [rug](https://crates.io/crates/rug), it can use [arbitrary-precision numbers (aka BigNum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic).
